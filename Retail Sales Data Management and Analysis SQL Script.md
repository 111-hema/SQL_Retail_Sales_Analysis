  This SQL project script is designed to manage and analyze a retail sales dataset through a series of data cleaning, exploration, and analytical steps. Initially, the code identifies and removes any records with missing values in critical fields (e.g., transaction_id, sale_date, customer_id) to ensure data completeness. Following this, the script explores the data by calculating total records, unique customer counts, and distinct product categories. Finally, it performs analysis by executing targeted queries, such as retrieving sales data for specific dates, to support further business insights. This structured approach helps maintain data quality while providing meaningful summaries and insights into retail performance.
